# Use this script to verify the correctness of your key-breaking software
# The script expects as input two files. The first first is a list of known bad keys (we've provided you some for
# the short key files) and your candidate list of broken moduli (e) and corresponding private key (d).
# The format of the first file is a string, decimal representation of an RSA moduli
# The format of the second file is n:d, where n and d are string, decimal representation of an RSA moduli
# and its corresponing private key d, delinated by a colon.
# This scripts checks that you have both found the total number of broken moduli, and correctly computed
# the private key (thus showing you know how to factor n).
